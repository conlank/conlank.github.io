My name is Conlan Kreher, I have a Master's in Biochemistry and an interest in Data Science.

- I like to bike, swim, climb and hike.
- I make generative art sometimes, maybe I'll post more of it online.
- I like to do electronics/3d printing projects.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
